# MusGator
This application can be used to learn parts of music theory through a variety of hands-on tools. The app provides users with a lesson section to learn different notes, sounds, and symbols. Afterwards, they can put their knowledge to the test in the quiz section to correctly identify information, images, and replicate pitches. The app is free to use and solves the problem of providing accessibility  and knowledge of music to those who struggle to find educational tools.

The app was developed by a team of seniors in the computer science department at the University of Florida, hence the name "MusGators" (Music Gators). The project stems from the Senior Project Class (CIS4914) and combines our previous knowledge in the computer science curriculum with our love for music. The team is comprised of:
<ul>
  <li>Abigail M. Martinez</li>
  <li>Connor F. Rolfs</li>
  <li>Taylor Frederick</li>
  <li>Zachary J. Krol</li>
</ul>

Support for the app will be limited after Spring 2023.
